Hi there, I am Hayat!

I am a Research Fellow at the Centre for Research in Economic Development and International Trade (CREDIT) at the University of Nottingham, UK. As an applied research economist, my work spans multidisciplinary areas intersecting economics, agriculture, food, and the environment. My current research explores a wide range of economic and environmental problems affecting rural and farming communities, with a particular emphasis on low- and middle-income countries, agriculturally marginal areas, and indigenous communities. 

I hold a PhD in Development and Agricultural Economics from the School of Economics at the University of Nottingham, UK. Additionally, I earned a masters degree in Agricultural Economics from Purdue University in Indiana USA, and a BSc in Agronomy and Soil Sciences from Kabul University, Afghanistan. My expertise includes economic modeling, particularly in evaluating the developmental impact of economic interventions and agricultural/environmental policies using quasi-experimental data. I am skilled in data collection, fieldwork, survey design, and conducting feasibility studies and economic experiments. My research often assesses ex-ante economic decisions made by various agents, such as willingness to pay, accept, or participate in adopting innovative technologies, best management practices, and adaptation strategies. I am skilled in econometric and predictive analytics, with extensive experience analyzing complex datasets using STATA, R, and SPSS.

After completing my PhD in 2019, I joined  the International Center for Biosaline Agriculture (ICBA) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, as Postdoctoral Research Fellow (Socioeconomic Scientist).  At ICBA, I primarily focused on developing research proposals and designing and implementing research and development projects in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Sub-Saharan Africa, and Central Asia regions. Prior to this role, I served as a faculty member (lecturer) in the Department of Agricultural Economics and Extension at Kabul University, Afghanistan. Additionally, i worked as an Economist with the Comprehensive Agriculture and Rural Development-Facility (CARD-F), an Economic Development Program funded and implemented by the Department for International Development (DfID) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock (MAIL) to promote sustainable agriculture and rural development in Afghanistan. My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals, such as The Journal of Development Studies, PLOS ONE, Progress in Development Studies, Middle East Development Journal, and Sustainability. Additionally, I have authored policy briefs, technical reports, and contributed to book chapters.
