Hi there, I am Hayat!
 
I am a Research Fellow at the Centre for Research in Economic Development and International Trade (<a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/credit/" target="_blank">CREDIT</a>) at the <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Nottingham</a>, UK. As an applied research economist, my work spans multidisciplinary areas intersecting economics, agriculture, food, and the environment. My current research explores a wide range of economic and environmental problems affecting rural and farming communities, with a particular emphasis on low- and middle-income countries, agriculturally marginal areas, and indigenous communities.

I hold a PhD in Development and Agricultural Economics from the <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/economics/" target="_blank">School of Economics</a> at the <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Nottingham</a>, UK. Additionally, I earned a masters degree in <a href="https://ag.purdue.edu/department/agecon/" target="_blank">Agricultural Economics</a> from <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">Purdue University</a> in Indiana USA, and a BSc in <a href="https://ku.edu.af/en/department-agronomy-0" target="_blank">Agronomy and Soil Sciences</a> from <a href="https://ku.edu.af/en" target="_blank">Kabul University</a>, Afghanistan. My expertise includes economic modeling, particularly in evaluating the developmental impact of economic interventions and agricultural/environmental policies using quasi-experimental data. I am skilled in data collection, fieldwork, survey design, and conducting feasibility studies and economic experiments. My research often assesses ex-ante economic decisions made by various agents, such as willingness to pay, accept, or participate in adopting innovative technologies, best management practices, and adaptation strategies. I am skilled in econometric, quantitative analysis, and predictive analytics, with extensive experience analyzing complex datasets using STATA, R, Python, and SPSS.

After completing my PhD in 2019, I joined  the <a href="https://www.biosaline.org/" target="_blank">International Center for Biosaline Agriculture (ICBA)</a> in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, as Postdoctoral Research Fellow (Socioeconomic Scientist).  At ICBA, I primarily focused on developing research proposals and designing and implementing research and development projects in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Sub-Saharan Africa, and Central Asia regions. Prior to this role, I served as a faculty member (lecturer) in the <a href="https://ku.edu.af/en/department-agricultural-economics-and-extension" target="_blank">Department of Agricultural Economics and Extension</a> at <a href="https://ku.edu.af/en" target="_blank">Kabul University</a>, Afghanistan. Additionally, i worked as an Economist with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evaluation-of-comprehensive-agriculture-rural-development-facility-programme/" target="_blank">Comprehensive Agriculture and Rural Development-Facility (CARD-F)</a>, an Economic Development Program funded and implemented by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development" target="_blank">Department for International Development (DfID)</a> and the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock (MAIL) to promote sustainable agriculture and rural development in Afghanistan. My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals, such as The Journal of Development Studies, PLOS ONE, Progress in Development Studies, Middle East Development Journal, and Sustainability. Additionally, I have authored policy briefs, technical reports, and contributed to book chapters.
